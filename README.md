# Trader Performance vs Market Sentiment

This project analyzes the relationship between trader performance (PnL) and market sentiment using:

- Historical trader data
- Fear & Greed Index sentiment
- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Seaborn for visual analysis

##  What I Did

- Cleaned and preprocessed two datasets (trader logs & sentiment index)
- Merged based on date alignment
- Visualized correlations between sentiment and Closed PnL
- (Bonus) Engineered lag features for sentiment impact prediction

## 
Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas, NumPy
- Seaborn, Matplotlib

##  Insights
Preliminary findings suggest market sentiment classification (Fear, Greed, etc.) may correlate with trader behavior/performance patterns.
